    <h2>Steps for cooking</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First of all, of course, we should boil the pasta in lightly salted water until it is fully cooked and drain it.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, you can grate the cheese on a coarse grater, cut the sausages into slices and beat the egg in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten egg, a glass of milk, cheese, mustard powder and sliced sausages to the hot pasta and mix well.</li>
        <li>Put the resulting pasta mass into a baking dish and put it in a preheated 180-degree oven for about 15 minutes.</li>
