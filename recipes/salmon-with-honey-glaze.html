        <ol>
            <li>Toast the coriander seeds in a dry large frying pan over medium heat, stirring constantly, until golden, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool. Grind the seeds with a mortar and pestle.</li>
            <li>Make the glaze. Mix the crushed coriander seeds, copper, soy sauce and lemon juice in a small bowl. Lightly brush the top of each salmon fillet with the glaze. Heat the oil in a shallow frying pan over medium heat. Cook the salmon fillets for 1 minute, reduce the heat to low and cook for 2 minutes. cook for a further 3 minutes, if necessary, until the salmon is slightly pink in the centre. Put it on a dish and cover with foil.</li>
            <li>Pour the rest of the glaze into the pan, bring to a boil over medium heat. cook until the glaze thickens to the consistency of syrup, about 1 minute. Serve the salmon with the glaze.</li>
